# Wierdio Clicker Archives
So.... welcome to the Wierdio Clicker repository!
	I (Wierdio) programmed in VB.NET the simple game Wierdio Clicker. I found some old versions and wanted to preserve them. I also wanted to make them public. Why not use GitHub? So, now that we are caught up, download a version and test it!


NEW: Source code added! Go to the source-code branch!
